    "# CSC 8614 - Language Models\n",
    "## CI2 - Fine-tuning a language model for text classification\n",
    "\n",
    "In this TP, you will work on fine-tuning a language model to move from text generation to text classification, specifically working on Spam Detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercise (and code) has been adapted from the book _Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)_, by Sebastian Raschka, and its [official github repository](https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch).\n",
    "\n",
    "This TP will be done in this notebook, and requires some additional files (available from the course website). You will have to fill the missing portions of code, and perform some additional experiments by testing different parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working on this TP:\n",
    "- The easiest way is probably to work directly on the notebook, using jupyter notebook or visual studio code. An alternative is also to use Google colab.\n",
    "- You should be able to run everything on your machine, but you can connect to the GPUs if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some files are required, and are available on the course website:\n",
    "- `requirements.txt`\n",
    "- `gpt_utils.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## About the report\n",
    "You will have to return this notebook (completed), as well as a mini-report (`TP2/rapport.md`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook and report shall be submitted via a GitHub repository, similarly to what you did for the first session (remember to use a different folder: `TP2`).\n",
    "For the notebook, it is sufficient to complete the code and submit the final version.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the mini-report, you have to answer the questions asked in this notebook, and discuss some of your findings as requested.\n",
    "As for the first session:\n",
    "- \"Vous devez y mettre : réponses courtes, résultats observés (copie de sorties), captures d’écran demandées, et une courte interprétation.\"\n",
    "- \"Ne collez pas des pages entières : soyez concis et sélectionnez les éléments pertinents.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Reproducibility: \n",
    "- fix a random seed and write it in the report\n",
    "- indicate in the report the specific python version OS, and the library versions."
